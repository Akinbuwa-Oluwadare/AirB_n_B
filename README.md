### Overview

Airbnb is an American vacation rental online marketplace company based in San Francisco, California. Airbnb maintains and hosts a marketplace, accessible to consumers on its website or via an app. Through the service, users can arrange lodging, primarily homestays, and tourism experiences or list their properties for rental. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.

Over the years, tourists/travelers are not worried about where they are going to sleep/reside anytime they are on vacation or business trips even if they have family members or friends living in that city or not.

In this project, analysis will be conducted on Airbnb listings of New-york city for the year 2019 through various ways so as to create/show meaningful insights with this project.
